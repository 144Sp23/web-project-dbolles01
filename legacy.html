        <p>Upon release, this game set the bar for how new games would develop. Being the first 3D Zelda game, it had a lot of hype behind it's release. Although we have had 3D games, this was completely different and pathed the way to the open world and explorative games we have today where you can progress things in  your own way and not in a linear path.
        </p>
        <p>The game introduced many of us to the series as children, and even new players today start with this gem in order to discover the brilliance of the series. There is no better game to start with.</p>
        <p>There is no surprise it is the highest rated game, this is the only game to score a 99% on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/nintendo-64/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">metacritic</a>, and has a 10/10 score on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/11/26/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-review">IGN.</a></p>
